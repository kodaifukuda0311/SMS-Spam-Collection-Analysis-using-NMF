This report is my final project for DTSA5510 Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning.

The SMS Spam Collection is a public set of SMS labeled messages that have been collected for mobile phone spam research. We can download the dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection). The collection is composed by just one text file, where each line has the correct class followed by the raw message. The classification task for this dataset is to determine whether a given message is spam or not. In this project, I focus on Non-negative Matrix Factorization which is widely used in various fields including Topic modeling and Recommender systems.
